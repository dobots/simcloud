#  How to get started with Docker images

## Step 1: Install Docker
Install Docker: [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/](https://meet.google.com/linkredirect?authuser=1&dest=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.docker.com%2Fengine%2Finstall%2Fubuntu%2F)
To run docker without super user:
```
  sudo groupadd docker
  sudo gpasswd -a ${USER} docker
  sudo service docker restart
```

> **_NOTE:_** To check whether you can run Docker without sudo or just to test the installation run: 
	    `docker run hello-world` or to check your Docker version:`docker  -v`

## Step 2: Install Nvidia acceleration:
[https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker](https://meet.google.com/linkredirect?authuser=1&dest=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.nvidia.com%2Fdatacenter%2Fcloud-native%2Fcontainer-toolkit%2Finstall-guide.html%23docker)

**Note:** If your setup uses graphics other than nvidia, you can try using the alternative script `run_no_nvidia.sh` (The 'no_nvidia' script removes the option `--runtime=nvidia`). For more information, see http://wiki.ros.org/docker/Tutorials/Hardware%20Acceleration.


## Step 3: Build the Docker image

Move into the folder of the docker image you would like to use and build it:
```
cd ~/docker	
cd ros_melodic_desktop_px4	
docker build -t ros_melodic_desktop_px4 .	
```

> **_NOTE:_** Check if your image has been succesfully build: `docker image list`

## Step 4: Start a container
	
```
cd ros_melodic_desktop_px4
./run.sh
```
Try to run e.g.: `roscore`
	
> **_NOTE:_**  In case of errors make the script executable and try to run it again: `chmod +x run.sh`


## Step 5: Using multiple terminals
To open a new terminal window run:
```
docker exec -it ros_melodic_desktop_px4 /bin/bash
# Source the environment variables
. ros_entrypoint.sh
```
Run e.g turtlesim in the new terminal:`rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node`

## Step 6: Creating a ROS workspace, which is connected to the filesystem outside of the Docker container

Move in to the directory where you would like to create your ROS workspace:`cd`.
Then run the Docker container from this folder:
```
\your\path\to\the\docker\container\run.sh
```
Inside the Docker container move into the `projects` directory. Everything what you do inside the projects directory will be stored in the folder where you started your Docker image. e.g.
```
cd projects
mkdir -p simcloud_ws/src
cd simcloud_ws/
catkin_make
```
